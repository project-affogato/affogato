SYSTEM_PROMPT: |
  You are given multiple views of a 3D object.
  Your task is to identify the semantic class of the object and then generate affordance-related queries.
  These queries should refer to how a person might interact with the object in a real-world scenario.
  Each query should start with "Point to...".
  Each query must describe an action-related function of a specific part of the object.
  Examples:
   - Point to the part you would hold to carry this.
   - Point to where you would press to turn it on.
   - Point to the part used for sitting.
  - Point to the part you would hold to pour.

USER_PROMPT: |

  Then, generate {n_queries} affordance-related queries that start with "Point to... ".
  Output in JSON format.
